2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

-You will want to use a database when you have multiple users adding new data, retrieving, updating and/or removing data. Databases can be accessed using SQL. 
-You would use a text file if you are dealing with a single user, one at a time write access or simpler data structures. With a text file, you are required to know how the data is structured in your file in order to modify it at all.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

-SQL is a declarative rather than a procedural language.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

-A database is an application that allows users to manage data through some kind of interface. Databases store data in a specialized language that is not readable by humans. They store data in tables, and within tables, there are rows, columns, and values. They use a special language known as SQL in order to read and modify data.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

-A table contains rows and columns for the data it contains. In a database for an online business, you might have a Customers table and a Products table.

-A row represents a specific data entry or instance. For example, we may have a users table and each row represents a unique user.

-Each column represents a specific data characteristic. For example, we may have a users table with a column for name, a column for email address, a column for phone number, etc.

-A value represents a specific data attribute for a specific instance or entry. In other words, it's where row meets column. For example, in a users table, we may have an entry for Joe Smith. In the row, 'Joe Smith', 867-5309, and joe@smith.com would all be values in adjacent columns. 

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

-string, integer, and float.
